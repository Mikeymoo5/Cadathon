# Cadathon
This is my "cadathon" in which I design as many fucntional models to be 3D printed as possible!

List of files:
Card Adapter - An adapter that turns a keychain discount card into a full sized card so that it fits in a phone wallet without getting stuck
Sharpie adapter - An adapter for my box cutter holster so that I can carry a sharpie and boxcutter around without hvaing to take up pocket space while i am working
